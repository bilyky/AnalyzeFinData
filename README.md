# AnalyzeFinData — PowerGauge Stock Screener

Stock screener for ~485 symbols. Pulls live data from the Chaikin Analytics API, computes
entry-quality scores from local OHLCV history, and writes results into `Data/investment.xlsx`.

## How It Works

```

       ↑ written by check_from_xls()
       │
powergauge.py  ←── Chaikin API (live PGR, signals, price)

```

**Three-phase run inside `check_from_xls`:**

| Phase | What happens | Threading |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| 1. Collect | Read Research sheet, gather valid symbol rows | Serial |
| 2. Fetch | Call Chaikin API for every unique symbol | Parallel (`CHAIKIN_WORKERS`, default 10) |
| 3. Compute + Write | Compute scores, write cells | Serial |

---

## Setup

**Requirements:** Python 3.11+, packages in the virtualenv (`venv/`).

```bash
# Activate the virtualenv (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

# Key packages (already installed in venv)
# openpyxl  requests  urllib3  playwright
```

The `venv/` directory is gitignored — it ships with the repo only for local use.
If you recreate it: `pip install openpyxl requests urllib3 playwright`.

---

## Credentials

The screener needs a Chaikin Analytics session. Two credential sources are tried
**in this order**:

### 1. Environment variables (preferred)

```
CHAIKIN_EMAIL=your@email.com
CHAIKIN_PASSWORD=yourpassword
```

### 2. Config file

Copy the example and fill in your values:

```bash
cp chaikin_config.json.example chaikin_config.json
```

```json
{
  "email": "your@email.com",
  "password": "yourpassword"
}
```

`chaikin_config.json` is gitignored and will never be committed.

### Session token

On first run the screener logs in automatically and saves a session token to
`Data/session.txt`. Subsequent runs reuse the cached token (valid ~24 h).
If the token expires the screener re-authenticates automatically.

---

## Running the Screener

### Full run — all symbols in investment.xlsx

```python
import datetime
import powergauge

date = datetime.date.today()
powergauge.check_from_xls(prefer_cache=False, date=date)
```

### Targeted run — specific symbols only

```python
powergauge.check_from_xls(prefer_cache=False, date=date, symbols=["AAPL", "NVDA", "MSFT"])
```

### From cache (no API calls for symbols already fetched today)

```python
powergauge.check_from_xls(prefer_cache=True, date=date)
```

### Single-symbol test

```python
import datetime
import powergauge

pg = powergauge.get_symbol_data("AAPL", datetime.date.today(), prefer_cache=False, session_id="...")
print(pg.price, pg.pgr_corrected_value)
```

### File-based run (symbols_to_check.txt)

```python
powergauge.check_from_file(prefer_cache=False, date=date)
```

### If Excel is open when the run finishes

The screener detects the file-lock and saves to `Data/investment_pending_<timestamp>.xlsx`.
Close Excel, then rename/copy that file over `investment.xlsx`.

### `state_of_the_day.xlsx` (source) → `Data/state_of_the_day.xlsx` (generated)

The **root-level `state_of_the_day.xlsx` is the source workbook** — the watchlist
symbols plus the Short_Long real-account holdings. The screener
(`powergauge.check_from_xls(...)`) reads it as `SRC_XLSX` and writes the enriched,
scored copy to **`Data/state_of_the_day.xlsx`** (`XLSX_FILE`) — the file the
dashboard, pipeline, and AI game read at runtime. The root source is tracked in the
repo; the generated `Data/` copy is git-ignored (all of `Data/` is).

If `Data/state_of_the_day.xlsx` is open in Excel when a run finishes, powergauge
saves the changes to `Data/investment_pending_<timestamp>.xlsx` instead; close Excel
and copy that over `Data/state_of_the_day.xlsx`.

---

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `CHAIKIN_EMAIL` | — | Login email (overrides config file) |
| `CHAIKIN_PASSWORD` | — | Login password (overrides config file) |
| `CHAIKIN_API_KEY` | Chaikin web-app default | Client API key; rotate if Chaikin updates it |
| `CHAIKIN_WORKERS` | `10` | Parallel fetch thread count |
| `REGIME_SYMBOL` | `RSP` | Ticker for market regime SMA(50). Set to `""` to disable |
| `HTTPS_PROXY` / `HTTP_PROXY` | — | Corporate proxy URL (passed to all requests) |

### Symbol cache layout (after reorganisation)

```
Data/Symbol/
├── AAPL/
│   ├── AAPL_2025-05-16.json
│   └── AAPL_2025-05-19.json
├── NVDA/
│   └── NVDA_2025-05-19.json
└── ...
```

The screener reads from `Symbol/<SYM>/<SYM>_<DATE>.json` and falls back to the
old flat `Symbol/<SYM>_<DATE>.json` if the file isn't found in the subdir.
New fetches are always written into the per-symbol subdir.

---

### Symbol_full JSON format

Each file is a standard Alpha Vantage "Time Series (Daily)" response:

```json
{
  "Time Series (Daily)": {
    "2025-05-16": {
      "1. open":   "189.30",
      "2. high":   "191.05",
      "3. low":    "188.50",
      "4. close":  "190.20",
      "5. volume": "52340100"
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Reorganising the Symbol Cache

Run this once to move all flat `Data/Symbol/<SYM>_<DATE>.json` files into
per-symbol subdirectories. Handles any number of files; safe to re-run (already-moved
files are skipped because they don't appear in the flat root any more).

```bash
python scripts/utils/organize_symbol_files.py
```

**What it does:**

1. Scans `Data/Symbol/` for files matching `<SYM>_<DATE>.json`
2. Creates `Data/Symbol/<SYM>/` for each unique symbol
3. Moves every file into its symbol's subfolder
4. Prints progress every 10,000 files and a final summary

**Expected output (first run on a full dataset):**

```
  10000/414264 moved...
  ...
  410000/414264 moved...
Done: 414264 files moved into 528 symbol folders.
```

**`powergauge.py` is fully compatible with both layouts:**

| Operation | Subdir path tried first | Flat fallback |
|-----------|------------------------|---------------|
| Cache read (`prefer_cache=True`) | `Symbol/<SYM>/<SYM>_<DATE>.json` | `Symbol/<SYM>_<DATE>.json` |
| Cache write (after API fetch) | `Symbol/<SYM>/` (created if absent) | — |
| Index scan (`_build_cache_index`) | `os.walk` — picks up both flat and subdir | — |

No code changes are needed before or after running the script.

---

## Changing the Folder Structure

All folder paths are derived from `__file__` — no hardcoded absolute paths.
To move the project or its data, change only these constants near the top of each file:

### `powergauge.py`

```python
SESSION_FILE = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), "Data", "session.txt")
XLSX_FILE    = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), "Data", "investment.xlsx")
XLSX_BACKUP_DIR = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), "Data", "Backup")
OHLCV_DIR    = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), "Data", "Symbol_full")
```

Change `"Data"` or add subdirectory segments as needed, e.g.:

```python
OHLCV_DIR = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), "MarketData", "OHLCV")
```

### `scoring.py`

```python
# Inside market_regime():
path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)),
                    "Data", "Symbol_full", f"{REGIME_SYMBOL}_daily.json")
```

Change `"Data", "Symbol_full"` to match your new OHLCV location.

### `scripts/sync/sync_data.py`

```python
SRC = Path(r"D:\Develop\AnalyzeFinData_1\Data")
DST = Path(r"D:\Develop\AnalyzeFinData\Data")
```

Update both absolute paths to match your environment.

---

## Testing

Tests are plain `unittest.TestCase` — no pytest required.

### Run all tests

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Expected output: **270 tests, 0 failures.**

### Run a single file

```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_scoring -v
python -m unittest tests.test_compute -v
```

### Test coverage

| File | Classes | What is tested |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `tests/test_scoring.py` | 9 | `_to_float`, `week_of_month`, `predicted_win_pct`, `ohlcv_streak_perc`, `ohlcv_streak_count`, `rel_volume_bucket`, `short_score`, `long_score`, `market_regime` |
| `tests/test_compute.py` | 5 | `_pgr_str`, `_buying_ratio`, `_compute_pgr_fields`, recursion depth cap, symbol path validation |

`tests/conftest.py` provides `make_ohlcv(closes, volumes, highs, lows)` — builds a
synthetic Alpha Vantage time-series dict from plain price lists. Use it in new tests.

### Adding a test

```python
# tests/test_scoring.py
from tests.conftest import make_ohlcv

class TestMyNewThing(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_something(self):
        ohlcv = make_ohlcv([100, 102, 101, 105])
        result = my_function(ohlcv)
        self.assertEqual(result, expected)
```

### Regression guards

`TestShortScore.test_regression_exact_weights` and
`TestLongScore.test_regression_exact_weights` pin the exact numeric output of
`short_score` / `long_score` for a known input. If you change factor weights in
`scoring.py`, update these tests to match — they are intentional canaries.

## Excel Output — Column Reference

### Research sheet (one row per symbol)

Columns A–D and I, Q are pre-existing and preserved by the screener.

| Col | Excel | Field | Description |
|-----|-------|-------|-------------|
| A | A | — | Preserved (user data) |
| B | B | — | Preserved |
| C | C | — | Preserved |

---

## Score Definitions

### BR Score (Buying Ratio) — column V

Composite entry-quality signal combining multiple Chaikin signals and OHLCV-derived factors.
Range: −10 to +10.

| Component | Contribution |
|-----------|-------------|
| PGR (1→5) | −2 to +2 (linear) |
| R/R ratio | 0→−1, ≥0.5→+0.5, ≥1→+1, ≥2→+1.5, ≥3→+2 |
| LT Trend | Weak +1, Strong −1 |
| Money Flow | Strong +0.75, Weak −0.75 |
| OB/OS | Optimal +1, Early +0.25, Wait −0.25 |
| Industry | Weak +0.5, Strong −0.5 |
| PGR Delta | Any change +0.25 |
| Seasonality | −1.0 to +1.0 |

**Thresholds:** ≥4 strong buy · 2–4 moderate · 0–2 weak · −2–0 avoid · ≤−2 strong avoid

### Win% 10d — column X

Predicted 10-day win rate from backtest (238k obs, 466 symbols, 2023–2025):

| BR range | Win% |
|----------|------|
| ≥ 4.0 | 64.3% |
| 2.0 – 3.9 | 57.6% |
| 0.0 – 1.9 | 53.1% |
| −2.0 – −0.1 | 50.3% |
| ≤ −2.1 | 46.3% |

### Short10 — column Y

10-day entry-quality score. Factor weights derived from 336k observations (2023–2025),
NA-filtered. Range: −10 to +10.

| Factor | Weight (% spread) | Values |
|--------|-------------------|--------|
| Rel Volume | 4.4% | High +2.5, Very High +0.5, Normal 0, Low −2.0 |
| OB/OS | 4.3% | Optimal +3.0, Early +1.0, Neutral 0, Wait −2.0 |
| Money Flow | 3.5% | Strong +3.0, Neutral 0, Weak −2.0 |
| Industry Str | 3.1% (contrarian) | Weak +2.0, Strong −2.0 |
| LT Trend | 2.1% (contrarian) | Weak +1.5, Neutral 0, Strong −1.5 |
| Seasonality | — | −1.0 to +1.0 |
| Market Regime | — | Bull +1.0, Neutral 0, Bear −1.0 |

> PGR, PGR Delta, and R/R all showed <2% spread at 10d — excluded.

**Very High volume is dampened (+0.5, not +2.5)** — news-driven spikes degrade entry quality.

**Industry and LT Trend are contrarian** — oversold sectors and extended-down trends
show stronger forward returns (recovery effect).

### Long60 — column Z

60-day position-quality score. Same methodology, different weights. Range: −10 to +10.

| Factor | Weight (% spread) | Values |
|--------|-------------------|--------|
| LT Trend | 4.5% (contrarian) | Weak +4.0, Neutral 0, Strong −3.0 |
| Rel Volume | 2.8% | High +2.0, Very High 0, Normal 0, Low −1.0 |
| Money Flow | 2.5% | Strong +2.5, Neutral 0, Weak −2.0 |
| Industry Str | 2.4% (contrarian) | Weak +2.0, Strong −1.5 |
| OB/OS | 2.3% | Optimal +1.5, Early +0.5, Neutral 0, Wait −0.5 |
| Seasonality | — | −0.5 to +0.5 (scaled by 0.5×) |
| Market Regime | — | Bull +1.5, Neutral 0, Bear −1.5 |

> The LT Trend contrarian effect is twice as strong at 60d vs 10d (4.5% vs 2.1%).

### Market Regime

Read from `Data/Symbol_full/<REGIME_SYMBOL>_daily.json`. SMA(50) computed on
all trading days up to and including the run date.

| Regime | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| Bull | Price > SMA(50) by more than 2% |
| Bear | Price < SMA(50) by more than 2% |
| Neutral | Within ±2% of SMA, or data unavailable |

Default symbol: `RSP` (equal-weight S&P 500). Override with `REGIME_SYMBOL` env var.
Set to `""` to disable (all symbols treated as Neutral).

## Backtest Summary

- **Dataset:** 336k observations, ~485 symbols, Jan 2023 – Dec 2025
- **Method:** Walk-forward, no look-ahead. OHLCV from Alpha Vantage daily files.
- **Entry filter (t+d3):** Price > SMA(20) AND Price > Close[3d ago]
  - Lifts 10-day win rate by ~16 percentage points vs no filter
  - Validated on 51/51 test symbols
- **Key findings:**
  - Money Flow is the single strongest predictor at both 10d and 60d
  - PGR adds no measurable signal at horizons < 60d
  - Very High volume (news spikes) degrades short-term returns vs High volume
  - LT Trend and Industry Strength are both contrarian — oversold > overbought
  - NA values in scoring columns skew 60d results; always filter before analysing
